    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 egg yolksr</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the berries into the container of a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth. Pour into a large bowl, and
        set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 1/4 cups of the cream in a saucepan over medium heat until it begins to bubble at the edge of the pan. In a large
        bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg yolks, remaining 1/4 cup cream, and corn syrup. Gradually pour the hot cream into
        the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Return the mixture to the saucepan, and heat until the mixture is thick
        enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, about 5 minutes. Do not allow the mixture to boil. Strain custard into the
        berry puree through a sieve, mix, and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
        <li>Fill an ice cream maker with the mixture, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
